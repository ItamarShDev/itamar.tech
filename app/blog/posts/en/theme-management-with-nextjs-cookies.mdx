## The Challenge of Theme Management

Modern web applications need to support multiple themes - typically light and dark modes - while ensuring a seamless user experience. An effective theme system should:

- Persist user preferences across sessions
- Apply theme changes instantly without page reloads
- Work with server-side rendering
- Minimize layout shifts during theme transitions
- Be easily extensible for additional themes

In this post, I'll explain how we implemented our theme management system using Next.js server actions, cookies for persistence, and React context for state management.

## The Architecture

Our theme system consists of three main components:

1. **Server-side storage** - Using Next.js cookies to persist theme preferences
2. **Theme provider** - A React context to make theme state available throughout the application
3. **Theme switcher components** - UI elements that allow users to change themes

Let's look at each component in detail.

## Server-Side Theme Storage

The foundation of our theme system is a set of server actions that handle theme persistence. Here's how we implement it:

```typescript
"use server";
import { revalidatePath } from "next/cache";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import type { Theme } from "providers/theme";

// Get the current theme from cookies
export async function getCurrentTheme() {
  const cookieCache = await cookies();
  const theme = cookieCache.get("current-theme")?.value || "dark";
  return theme as Theme;
}

// Set a new theme in cookies
export async function setCurrentTheme(theme: string) {
  const cookieCache = await cookies();
  cookieCache.set("current-theme", theme);
  revalidatePath("/", "layout");
  return theme;
}

// Toggle between dark and light themes
export async function toggleDarkTheme() {
  const theme = await getCurrentTheme();
  const newTheme = theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark";
  await setCurrentTheme(newTheme);
  return newTheme;
}
```

The key function here is `setCurrentTheme`, which:

1. Gets the cookie store using Next.js's `cookies()` API
2. Sets a cookie named "current-theme" with the new theme value
3. Calls `revalidatePath("/", "layout")` to revalidate the entire app's layout
4. Returns the new theme value

This server action approach leverages Next.js's built-in capabilities to handle cookies securely on the server side.

## Theme Provider Context

To make the theme available throughout our application, we use a React context provider:

```tsx
// providers/theme.tsx
"use client";
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
import { setCurrentTheme } from "lib/headers";

export type Theme = "light" | "dark" | "system";

// Create the theme context
const ThemeContext = createContext<{
  theme: Theme;
  selectTheme: (theme: Theme) => Promise<void>;
  toggleMode: () => Promise<void>;
}>({
  theme: "dark",
  selectTheme: async () => {},
  toggleMode: async () => {},
});

// Theme provider component
export function ThemeProvider({ 
  children, 
  currentThemeName 
}: { 
  children: React.ReactNode; 
  currentThemeName: Theme;
}) {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>(currentThemeName);

  // Function to select a specific theme
  const selectTheme = async (theme: Theme) => {
    document.body.setAttribute("data-theme", theme);
    await setCurrentTheme(theme);
    router.refresh();
    setTheme(theme);
  };

  // Function to toggle between light and dark
  const toggleMode = async () => {
    const newTheme = theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark";
    await selectTheme(newTheme);
  };

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, selectTheme, toggleMode }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Custom hook to use the theme
export const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext);
```

The theme provider does several important things:

1. Maintains the current theme state using React's `useState`
2. Provides a `selectTheme` function that:
   - Updates the DOM by setting a `data-theme` attribute on the body
   - Calls our server action to persist the theme in cookies
   - Refreshes the router to apply server-side changes
   - Updates the local state
3. Offers a convenient `toggleMode` function to switch between dark and light themes
4. Exposes these functions through a custom `useTheme` hook

## Applying Themes in the UI

With our theme provider in place, we can easily create UI components to change themes:

```tsx
// components/theme-switcher.tsx
"use client";
import { useTheme } from "providers/theme";

export function ThemeSwitcher() {
  const { theme, toggleMode } = useTheme();
  
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={toggleMode}
      aria-label={`Switch to ${theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'} mode`}
    >
      {theme === 'dark' ? '‚òÄÔ∏è' : 'üåô'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## The Complete Flow

When a user changes their theme preference, here's what happens:

1. The user clicks a theme toggle button, triggering the `toggleMode` or `selectTheme` function
2. The function immediately updates the DOM by setting a `data-theme` attribute on the body element
3. The server action `setCurrentTheme` is called, which:
   - Stores the new theme preference in a cookie
   - Revalidates the app's layout to ensure server components reflect the change
4. The router is refreshed to apply any server-side changes
5. The local state is updated, causing any components that depend on the theme to re-render

This approach gives us several benefits:

- **Immediate visual feedback** - The theme changes instantly by updating the DOM directly
- **Persistence across sessions** - Theme preferences are stored in cookies
- **Server-side rendering support** - The theme is available during SSR through cookies
- **No layout shifts** - By updating the DOM before server revalidation, we avoid layout shifts

## CSS Implementation

To make this work with CSS, we use CSS variables with different values based on the `data-theme` attribute:

```css
:root {
  --background: #ffffff;
  --text: #000000;
  /* Other light theme variables */
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --background: #121212;
  --text: #ffffff;
  /* Other dark theme variables */
}

body {
  background-color: var(--background);
  color: var(--text);
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease;
}
```

## Conclusion

This theme management system provides a robust solution for Next.js applications. By combining server actions, cookies, and React context, we've created a system that:

- Persists user preferences
- Works seamlessly with SSR
- Provides instant visual feedback
- Avoids layout shifts
- Is easily extensible

The use of Next.js server actions makes this approach particularly elegant, as it leverages the framework's built-in capabilities for handling server-side state while maintaining a clean separation of concerns.

Feel free to adapt this approach for your own projects, and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement!
